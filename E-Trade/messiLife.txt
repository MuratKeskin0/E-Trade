At 5, he showed great skills at a local club coached by his father.

At 11, he was diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency and had to seek medical assistance. His quote: "Every night I had to stick a needle into my legs, over a period of 3 years". Unfortunately, his family could not afford the treatment for long.

At 13, he got an offer from FC Barcelona that they would pay for his treatment, if he played for them. So his family moved to Spain with no money or job, all in the hope that his treatment will make him big enough to play soccer.

At 17, he became the youngest player in FC Barcelona history to score a goal.
